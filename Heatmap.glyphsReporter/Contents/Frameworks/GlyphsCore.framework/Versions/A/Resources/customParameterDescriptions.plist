In the four-letter tag, lowercase letters are reserved for predefined axes. Therefore, if you add a custom axis, use uppercase letters exclusively for the four-letter tag.

Put the `weightClass` value (400 in this example) in the left column, and the target mapping (436 in this example) in the right column. Note that axis mappings work only *per axis,* and cannot be adjusted for different positions of *other* axes. I.e., in this example, you may need to map 400 to 482 when the width is very narrow. But the `avar` implementation does not allow that, so you may have to compromise on one the mappings or pick an average value as the target mapping.";

From the Type 1 specification: The number specifies the ‘units to extend (in both directions) the effect of an alignment zone on a horizontal stem. If the top of a horizontal stem is within BlueFuzz units (in character space) outside of a top-zone, the interpreter will act as if the stem top were actually within the zone; the same holds for the bottoms of horizontal stems in bottom-zones. The default value of BlueFuzz is 1.
Adobe themselves state that BlueFuzz was intended to compensate ‘for slightly inaccurate coordinate data.’ They therefore suggest adjusting the alignment zones themselves as well as explicitly setting BlueFuzz to zero.
‘Because a non-zero value for BlueFuzz extends the range of alignment zones, alignment zones must be declared at least (2 × BlueFuzz + 1) units apart from each other. Therefore, a default BlueFuzz value of 1 implies that alignment zones should be at least 3 units apart from each other.’";

If you do not set the value yourself, blueScale defaults to 0.037, which corresponds to 9.37 points at 300 dpi or 39 pixels per em. This means that, in this case, overshoots will be visible if at least 40 pixels are used to display an em. The maximum blueScale value depends on the sizes of your alignment zones. The maximum pointsize at 300 dpi is calculated as 0.49 + 240 ÷ largest alignment zone size, which corresponds to a PPM (size in pixels per em) of 2.04 + 1000 ÷ largest alignment zone size. The product of (maximum pointsize – 0.49) × (largest alignment zone height) must be less than 240.

For example, your largest zone is 21 units deep, thus: 2.04 + 1000 ÷ 21 = 49.659, so the maximum PPM at which overshoots can be suppressed is 49. The corresponding maximum pointsize is 0.49 + 240 ÷ 21 = 11.919 points at 300 dpi, thus the blueScale value cannot exceed (11.919 – 0.49) ÷ 240 =  0.04762.";

E.g. blueScale is set to suppress overshoots until 32 PPM, blueShift is 6, overshoots are 12 units deep. The stroke endings are slightly slanted and extend 5 units below the baseline. Between 0 and 32 PPM, the baseline will be kept completely level. Starting at 33 PPM, the overshoots will kick in.

	- `isColorGlyph` Whether the glyph is a COLR/CPAL color glyph or not, e.g., ‘isColorGlyph=0’ removes all non-color glyphs from the font. 
	- `isAppleColorGlyph` Whether the glyph has an iColor layer for the `sbix` table or not.

From the Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification, Version1.0: ‘Both the CIDFont and the CMap must use CIDs from compatible character collections. The identification of the character collection is accomplished by placing version control information into each CIDFont and CMap file. To identify a character collection uniquely, three name components are concatenated with a hyphen:
* a registry name is used to identify an issuer of orderings, usually Adobe;
* an ordering name is used to identify an ordered character collection; and,
* a supplement number is used to indicate that the ordered character collection for a registry, ordering, and previous supplement has been changed to add new characters assigned CIDs beginning with the next available CID.

These three pieces of information taken together uniquely identify a character collection. In a CIDFont, this information declares what the character collection is. In a CMap, this information specifies which character collection is required for compatibility. A CMap is compatible with a CIDFont if the registry and ordering are the same.

- *Default Script:* ‘default script for OpenType features’.
- *Fallback Script:* ‘default script for glyphs that can’t be mapped to a script automatically’.
- *Hinting Limit:* the PPM size ‘where hinting gets switched off’.  Default is 200 pixels, must be larger than the maximum of the hint set range. Pixel sizes up to this size use the hinting configuration for the range maximum.
- *Fallback Stem Width:* ‘the horizontal stem width (hinting) value for all scripts that lack proper standard characters in the font. The value is given in font units and must be a positive integer. If not set, ttfautohint uses a hard-coded default (50 units at 2048 units per em, and linearly scaled for other UPM values, for example 24 units at 1000 UPM).’ For symbol fonts, you also need to specify a Fallback Script ‘to set up a script at all’.
- *x-Height Increase Limit:* from this pixel size down to 6 PPM, the x-height is more likely to be rounded up. Default is 14 PPM. ‘Normally, ttfautohint rounds the x height to the pixel grid, with a slight preference for rounding up. (…) Use this flag to increase the legibility of small sizes if necessary.’ Set to 0 if you want to switch off rounding up the x-height. 
- *x-Height Snapping Exceptions:* ‘list of comma-separated PPM values or value ranges at which no x-height snapping shall be applied’, e.g., ‘8, 10-13, 16’ disables x-height snapping for sizes 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16. An empty string means no exceptions, and a mere dash (‘-’) disables snapping for all sizes.
- *Adjust Subglyphs (formerly known as Pre-Hinting):* If enabled, ‘makes a font’s original bytecode be applied to all glyphs before it is replaced with bytecode created by ttfautohint. This makes only sense if your font already has some hints in it that modify the shape even at EM size (normally 2048px); in particular, some CJK fonts need this because the bytecode is used to scale and shift subglyphs (hence the option’s long name). For most fonts, however, this is not the case.’
- *Dehint:* Disables all TT hinting, and therefore overrides all other options. Use only for testing.
- *Detailed Info:* if enabled, adds ‘ttfautohint version and command line information to the version string or strings (with name ID 5) in the font’s `name` table. This option is mutually exclusive’ with the *No Autohint Info* option (see below). ‘If neither is set, the string “ttfautohint (vNNN)” gets added to the `name` table’, NNN being the ttfAutohint version.
- *Hint Composites:* ‘By default, the components of a composite glyph get hinted separately. If this flag is set, the composite glyph itself gets hinted (and the hints of the components are ignored). Using this flag increases the bytecode size a lot, however, it might yield better hinting results – usually, it doesn’t.’ Also adds a ghost component called .ttfautohint to all glyphs. ‘Direct rendering of the .ttfautohint subglyph (this is, rendering as a stand-alone glyph) disables proper hinting of all glyphs in the font! Under normal circumstances this never happens because .ttfautohint doesn’t have an entry in the font’s `cmap` table.’ But it can happen, e.g., in a glyph overview.
- *Ignore Restrictions:* ‘By default, fonts that have bit 1 set in the fsType field of the `OS/2` table are rejected. If you have a permission of the font’s legal owner to modify the font, specify this command line option.’
- *No Autohint Info:* if checked, prevents adding ‘ttfautohint version and command line information to the version string or strings (with name ID 5) in the font’s `name` table.’
- *Symbol Font:* ‘Process a font that ttfautohint would refuse otherwise because it can’t find a single standard character for any of the supported scripts. For all scripts that lack proper standard characters, ttfautohint uses a default (hinting) value for the standard stem width instead of deriving it from a script’s set of standard characters (for the latin script, one of them is character ‘o’). Use this option – usually in combination with the Fallback Script and/or Fallback Stem Width option – to hint symbol or dingbat fonts or math glyphs, for example.’
- *ttfa table:* Adds an OpenType table ‘called `TTFA` to the output font that holds a dump of all parameters. In particular, it lists all ttfautohint control instructions (which are not shown in the name table info). This option is mainly for archival purposes so that all information used to create a font is stored in the font itself. Note that such a `TTFA` table gets ignored by all TrueType rendering engines. Forthcoming versions of the ttfautohint front-ends will be able to use this data so that a font can be processed another time with exactly the same parameters, thus providing a means for round-tripping fonts.’
- *Windows Compatibility:* ‘This option makes ttfAutohint add two artificial blue zones, positioned at the `winAscent` and `winDescent` values (from the font’s `OS/2` table). The idea is to help ttfAutohint so that the hinted glyphs stay within this horizontal stripe since Windows clips everything falling outside.’ Use this option if clipping occurs in Microsoft Windows and you cannot adjust `winAscent` and `winDescent` instead (which would usually be the better option). In combination with ‘-’ as value for xHeight Snapping Exceptions (see above), it should both ‘suppress any vertical enlargement’ and ‘prevent almost all clipping.’
- *Strong Stems:* specifies which algorithm to use ‘for computing horizontal stem widths and the positioning of blue zones’ for the three rendering targets: Grayscale (Android), GDI ClearType (old Windows versions including XP), DW ClearType (IE 9 and later, and Windows 7 and later). If disabled, stems will be quantized: ‘Both stem widths and blue zone positions are slightly quantized to take discrete values. For example, stem values 50, 51, 72, 76, and 100 would become 50, 74, and 100 (or something similar). More glyph shape distortion but increased contrast.’ If enabled, stems will be strong: ‘Stem widths and blue zones are snapped and positioned to integer pixel values as much as possible. This gives high contrast, but glyph shape distortion can be significant.’";

This field is similar to the `hheaAscender` field as well as to the `winAscent` field. However, legacy platform implementations used those fields with platform-specific behaviors. As a result, those fields are constrained by backward-compatibility requirements, and they do not ensure consistent layout across implementations. The `typoAscender`, `typoDescender` and `typoLineGap` fields are intended to allow applications to lay out documents in a typographically-correct and portable fashion.

It is *not* a general requirement that `typoAscender` - `typoDescender` be equal to unitsPerEm. These values should be set to provide default line spacing appropriate for the primary languages the font is designed to support.

For CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) fonts that are intended to be used for vertical (as well as horizontal) layout, the required value for `typoAscender` is that which describes the top of the ideographic em-box. For example, if the ideographic em-box of the font extends from coordinates 0,-120 to 1000,880 (that is, a 1000 × 1000 box set 120 design units below the Latin baseline), then the value of `typoAscender` must be set to 880.

A virtual master makes most sense for design axes that only apply to a limited number of glyphs, e.g., an axis that controls the middle crossbar heights of letters like A, E, F and H.

‘The “Windows ascender” metric. This should be used to specify the height above the baseline for a clipping region. This is similar to the `typoAscender` field, and also to the `hheaAscender` field. There are important differences between these, however. In the Windows GDI implementation, the `winAscent` and `winDescent` values have been used to determine the size of the bitmap surface in the TrueType rasterizer. Windows GDI will clip any portion of a TrueType glyph outline that appears above the `winAscent` value. If any clipping is unacceptable, then the value should be set greater than or equal to yMax.
*Note:* This pertains to the default position of glyphs, not their final position in layout after data from the `GPOS` or `kern` table has been applied.
Some legacy applications use the `winAscent` and `winDescent` values to determine default line spacing. This is strongly discouraged. The `typoAscender`, `typoDescender` and `typoLineGap` fields should be used for this purpose.
Note that some applications use either the `winAscent `/`winDescent` values or the `typoAscender`/`typoDescender`/`typoLineGap` values to determine default line spacing, depending on whether the `Use Typo Metrics` flag is set. This may be useful to provide compatibility with legacy documents using older fonts, while also providing better and more-portable layout using newer fonts. Applications that use the `typoAscender`/`typoDescender`/`typoLineGap` fields for default line spacing can use the `winAscent`/`winDescent` values to determine the size of a clipping region. Some applications use a clipping region for editing scenarios to determine what portion of the display surface to re-draw when text is edited, or how large a selection rectangle to draw when text is selected. Early versions of this specification suggested that the `winAscent` value be computed as the yMax for all characters in the Windows ANSI character set. For new fonts, the value should be determined based on the primary languages the font is designed to support, and should take into consideration additional height that may be required to accommodate tall glyphs or mark positioning.’

Without any change, the smallcap zone would round and snap to a height of 6 pixels, while the x-height would end up with 5 pixels. If you set a value of 0.2, the smallcap height ends up at (6.45+0.2=6.65≈) 7 pixels, and the x-height at (5.25+2×0.2=5.65≈) 6 pixels.";

This usually matches the Full Name. If you want the name of the font to appear differently than the Full Name, you can insert the Compatible Full Name in ID 18.’ **Caution:** since this may lead to a situation where Mac and Windows use different full names for the same font, it may break cross-platform interoperability of documents.";

‘Used to provide a WWS-conformant family name in case the entries for IDs 16 (preferredFamilyName) and 17 (preferredSubfamilyName) do not conform to the WWS model. (That is, in case the entry for ID 17 includes qualifiers for some attribute other than weight, width or slope.)’ Frequent use cases are family names that indicate optical sizes: ‘Examples of name ID 21: “Minion Pro Caption” and “Minion Pro Display”.

The value specified is the amount of units that will be used for the font size. A smaller value will cause the font to appear larger on screen, and vice versa.

// Some applications, such as Adobe apps, use this value to sort the styles of a static (non-variable) font family in the font menu. Interpretation of this value varies greatly though. There used to be a bug in legacy Microsoft renderers which caused all fonts with a weight class lower than 250 to be artificially boldened on screen, because of which some type designers would not use any weight class value below 250. However, this limitation can be ignored for all Windows versions of this century.

// Other type engines only consider the hundreds digit, and ignore the tens and units, i.e., they make no difference between 400 and 425. Some systems ignore the value completely.";

By default, Glyphs uses a semicolon-separated concatenation of the version number, the 4-letter Vendor ID (UKWN if none is set), and the Font Name (postscriptFontName, OpenType name table ID 6), e.g., `1.005;UKWN;MyFont-Light`";

This constructed PostScript name cannot be longer than 127 characters. If no prefix is provided, the US English string for typographic (‘preferred’) family name (name ID 16) will be used, minus any characters not within ASCII A-Z, a-z and 0-9.

Microsoft: used as ‘family prefix in the PostScript Name Generation for Variation Fonts algorithm. The character set is restricted to ASCII-range uppercase Latin letters, lowercase Latin letters, and digits. All name strings for name ID 25 within a font, when converted to ASCII, must be identical.’

Adobe: ‘Including a Variations PostScript Name Prefix string (name ID 25) in a font could be useful in the following cases:
- if the US English typographic family name, US English named instance fvar subfamilyNameID, or the number of axis descriptors in the font could tip the length of the generated PostScript names to over 127 characters, or
- if the US English typographic family name contains accented or other characters that when removed by the algorithm ... could cause confusion or even ambiguity in PostScript names. For example, both typographic family names “André Sans” and “Andró Sans” resolve to family prefix “AndrSans”, an ambiguity that could be avoided by providing Variation PostScript Name Prefixes “AndreSans” and “AndroSans” in the fonts.’";
